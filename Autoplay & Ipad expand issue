Hi,
Im wondering if anyone has worked on mtAudioPlayer and was able to have autoplay working on page load?
Also if anyone sorted the glitch out when the player is playing on an Ipad. 
When the player collapse after pressing play you can't expand it anymore. The only way to work it is to refresh the page again.
